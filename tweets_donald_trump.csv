N,EVERY American ought devote the time to listen to this 51 minute radio interview: How Trump is Practicing Fascist Politics
N,"People are really tired of the whining. There's no conspiracy, no matter how much you try to conjure one up."
P,"Jesus wanted everyone to be equal and United as people. Socialism is exactly that, everyone being equal and United. The only reason communism was seen as bad was because of the Soviets oppressing their people."
P,You won't be laughing when Trump is inaugurated on the 20th of January
P,President Trump please dont give up remember the story of king Soloman and Adonijah

P,"Biden has 80 million votes. Do you believe it..... ??? As a result, the number of voters is more than the number of registered voters..... Biden's vote is too exaggerated..."
N,The Left runs the debates. The left runs the elections. The left runs the schools. Why do we allow this?
P,Really? One of many whistle blowers testifying.
P,"But Biden still leads . Wonder if any votes are missing in states that trum came from behind to win. Like Florida or Texas for instance . Maybe Graham did not win ,maybe he was able to get mail in ballots of deems . Thrown out as he is trying in states that Biden won"
N,"To be fair, he also promised to releases his taxes. And never pay golf. And Mexico would pay for the wall."
P,I live in Bucks County PA...my ex-husband lives in TX...he received a ballot at my address...he moved out in 2015...I'M CERTAIN he voted in TX...????

N,"From CHRISTIANITY TODAY, founded by Billy Graham: ""TRUMP SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE --- Its time to say what we said 20 years ago when a presidents character was revealed for what it was."""
N,"Problem was our elections weren't secure. YOU refused to take any real action. The people then took it upon themselves to secure elections in their own states. YOU don't get to cheat this time. BTW which is it, paper or electronic voting we should use? You keep flip floping."
P,"Yeah. Crazy isn't it. It's almost as if someone drew a lot of attention to this method and people were able to stay safe and vote. I seem to recall a lot of commercials about how bad it is, but then the state attorney general said it was safe and told us how to use this method."
P,Who is the entire world exactly? My guess is its a select elite that have a vested interest in wanting to see POTUS Trump fail@and not be taken seriously .. they are threatened by him so their line of defense is to try denigrate him publically.. a known political strategy.
N,"This was already ruled in a state court. Trump lost because he had republican poll officials observing. He just gets pissy and starts firing people who dont agree with him, i mean i guess he files lawsuits for the same reason."
N,un...when and on what planet did this happen? their checking produced a few thousand votes. not unusual in any recount . found some for Joe too. Nothing to make you even close to winning!

N,"SENATE INTEL REPORT: Trumps campaign chairman was in constant with a GRU military intel officer, passing internal polling data and secretly discussing campaign strategy and that Trump himself was in the loop. TRUMP WAS INSTALLED IN 2016. HES A FAKE PRESIDENT!"
N,There is no evidence of this claim. Lying is pointless. No rational person believes you. Meanwhile coronavirus is killing more people. Put America first
N,You are undermining our democracy and embarrassing yourself and your family
N,"The Biden's are exactly the opposite of you. Integrity, decency, intelligence with class is back in the White House. And I'm proud to say I helped put them there my vote counted."
N,You can scream "I won the election!" until the day you die. That won't change the facts. You lost!
N,"President Joe Biden has won in the most secure election in history, it was a landslide as Trumps lawyers drop their lawsuits & Rudy Giuliani makes a terrible mistake in court. ""M.A.D.A!"" Make America Decent Again! Which we did by electing #BidenHarris2020 "
N,He cannot understand "lost".

N,The insanity is all due to one thing ! Hes scared of Prison! The Trumps never looked better !
N,"Trump should have no ships, military bases, libraries, etc named after him for the same reason why students do not attend Benedict Arnold or Adolf Hitler high school."
N,"Which hospitals, which duties? Have you seen Europe?"
N,"You do understand that there are no signatures on ballots, right? There never has been and there never will be because it would violate the principle of the secret ballot."
N,Poor baby so sad he got rejected again
N,"Trump doesnt want to know what is going on right now! He is too busy trying to create and watch the results of his conspiracy theories, threats, abuse of power, undermining our democracy and national security on TV instead of getting briefed to save American lives."

N,Tell that to the birds
N,"Let me do the math, youre now losing by 13K votes. 24,500 Republicans didnt vote in the general election. You would have won by 11K + votes, had you not suppressed & depressed your own voting base."
N,Trump did not appear in public very often after his election defeat. Every now and then he was photographed playing golf. But the US president seems to be working in the background - and that's not a good sign for Joe Biden's successor in office.
N,"Lies, lies, and more lies."
N,"well, considering that catholicism was around before the other major Christian septs, i think that history disagrees with you"
N,Puppet Trump has claimed widespread fraud was at play in the presidential election. His lawyers have told judges in courtrooms across the country that they dont believe that to be true.
N,"Between light & shadow, science & superstition, at the pit of our fears & the summit of our knowledge sits a nation's worst nightmare. A monster of racism, fascism & narcissism who, in a state of infantile denial tantrum, seeks to destroy the very thing that made him. Democracy."
N,"Donald, you lost by 5,738,961 Votes! What part of that can't you understand?"
P,Why are democrats the only ones processing ballots? Why isn't this a red flag?

P,No we the people believe Trump.
P,I speak for every American Citizen when I say that we wont accept Biden as our President and that our 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DONALD JOHN TRUMP DESERVES A SECOND TERM. If this doesnt happen we are all moving to Mexico. RIGGED.

N,People are literally dying. How about going to work?
N,"But, youre still losing"
P,Cant wait till the voting machines that was pick up By the US Military in Venezuela Canada and Germany are brought to the public and shows how Biden cheated with the help of George sorrows
N,"He still lost in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Michigan, and Wisconsin he needed all those states"
P,Truth? Is that even in Trump's vocabulary?
N,His family is also embarrassing
N,"Not to mention that PA didnt have Mail-In voting in 2016.  Absentee, but not Mail-In."
N,Are we counting backwards now. That puts your king at 212

P,Who ELSE believes the INSTALLATION of Justice Amy "Handmaid" Coney Barrett should be INVALIDATED since the Chairman who RAMMED her Dubious Nomination thru the Senate Judiciary Committee has CLEARLY Committed Election Fraud & Election Tampering?
N,"This is America after four years of Donald Trump's presidency and his enablers in the Senate. Thousands of cars lined up to collect food in Dallas, Texas, over the weekend, stretching as far as the eye can see."
N,Imagine trying to stay in power based on rejecting as many ballots as possible without giving people a chance to correct the small technicalities that were easily fixable.
P,Whyd you put an o in c&t?

P,"It's not a mistake. It's not a series of glitches. America is under attack. Truth is under attack. The structures of our republic are under attack. It's coordinated, premeditated, and subversive. It is just ANOTHER strategy to cancel the Trump presidency, aka a coup."
N,"""NO EVIDENCE of US ELECTION FRAUD, says coalition of federal and state officials."" It ""was the most secure ever, says statement from cybersecurity experts, in clearest repudiation yet of Trumps claims."""
N,"You still lose by more than 13,000 votes."
P,"After repeatedly being asked by the judge, your attorneys admitted that your poll watchers were in the counting room. When the judge asked how many were allowed in, your attorney said, there were a non- zero amount in the room. Thats legalese for they were in there."
N,Trumps New Vote Fraud Theory Is So Much Crazier Than You Realize When craziness meets desperation.
N,"Mr. Trump, you're losing Pennsylvania by around 70,000 votes, and with that you lost election. Your fussing over this little this or that is certainly not going to flip the results in Pennsylvania. It's time for you to stop fooling everyone and to recognize reality. YOU LOST."
N,71 million Americans disagree.
N,Congratulations to our President-Elect and VP-Elect for winning the 30th time this week
P,"This is what I saw this morning. So exciting to know. A German whistleblower disclosed from Dominion server the actual data Trump was getting 410 on election night. Landslide! Left is from CNN, right is from actual data on Dominion."
N,Honestly. In 4 years. Can you think of a single statement he made thats been true? Literally his whole time in office he has spent covering his own lies with other lies.
N,Nope. Sorry. You said any votes that arrive after the deadline are illegal.
P,I saw observers standing in the arena behind the metal barriers about 6 from a vote counter It was on all the networks Im sure
N,"Maybe we need to revisit that 2016 vote count, 30x more rejections? No wonder your margin of victory was so narrow, they probably threw out votes from whole counties. This makes your 2016 victory even more suspicious."
N,How can you even fight for a job you refuse to do?!
N,"Democratic,Republican and Independent watchers were at each counting location. All you have left are lies and the less than 12,000 that showed up for your march."
P,the constitution is a fraud. Written by the deep state so Trump would lose the election.
N,"Wonder if they did anything to make mail in voting better...considering the pandemic.... unlike you who simply called everything rigged for the past 4 years, including when you won in 2016. We all know its hard to leave the nest. #TrumpConcedeNow"
N,"BREAKING: Trump's legal team just dismissed their BASELESS voter ""fraud"" lawsuit in #Wisconsin only hours before oral arguments were scheduled this morning, after initially claiming that evidence will be shortly forthcoming. "
N,"Only 6k or so SD cards and he may take the state, but will still lose the election. He'll need to check how late Best Buy is open and if SD cards are on sale..."
N,Are you a billionaire too or just a self-important?
P,So much winning!!!
P,Im old enough to remember 2 weeks ago when finding votes = obvious fraud. I wonder what changed?
N,"Under sharp questioning from Judge Paul S. Diamond, however, they conceded that Trump in fact had a nonzero number of people in the room, leaving Diamond audibly exasperated. Not only were the observers in the room, but it was live-streamed so anyone could watch. Idiots."
N,"The only thing missing is the, SS pins on the lapels. And where credit is due, a lousy few ballots too."
N,Good reminders. So much LOSING. If only hed kept it in the immediate crime family and not involved us.
N,"If they choose to live in different countries, thats on them but then they are no longer allowed to have say on anything that goes on while they are gone..."

P,THIS WILL PUT YOU OVER THE TOP 4 SURE SIR
P,"This is 100% factual. No honest person dispute this. As incompetent as many voters are, any reasonable person knows there should be a decent number of ballots not returned in a secret envelope. By law, those votes are invalidated. Where are those invalidated votes?"
P,As this President tweeted on Saturday: "EXPOSE THE CRIME." From eons ago (October 27): "U.S. Cant Replace TRUMP AS DEFENDANT in RAPE Accusers Suit."

N,"I cant stress this enough, there is literally a tweet, for every one of trumps, other tweets. Hypocrisy at a level not seen in decades, by a sitting president. Even Nixon would be like, dude seriously?"
P,As long as they are forced to file taxes and report their bank accounts they are very much allowed to have a say
N,"Trumps whining about the 2020 election which he LOST is 1,000% higher than Hillary Clintons was when she lost in 2016. Trumps refusal to accept his LOSS has become a national embarrassment."
P,When you win this election these democratic states should pay the price for it without a doubt
N,No political mercy for Donald Trump.
N,No dental work since he took office!!!!
N,"Your people were in the room. I know this as fact. MANY in PA voted by mail for first time and did it right, myself included. Instructions were everywhere. They didn't do that in 2016 nor were we permitted by our law to vote by mail if we could vote in person. Laws changed."
P,"The qualities of a great man are vision, integrity, courage, understanding, the power of articulation, and profundity of character. "
N,"Note to all those still working for Donald Trump: He's leaving office in 63 days whether he wants to, or not. That means for many of you, your job will be ending soon, too. So, speak out against this fool and keep your dignity and integrity while you can."
P,"How is it that the ballot counting machines, & those counting the ballots (boarding windows too), were privately funded? Is this legal to to have 100's of millions of privately-funded dollars paying for elections? Wouldn't the funder (Zuckerberg) want something for his money?"
P,"Anyone who understands increased mail-in voting due to an out-of-control pandemic (largely due to a lack of national leadership), the president's cruel plan to electioneer off the virus and need for mail-in voting, and simple math sees this for what it is. THE CHEATER LOST!"
P,Everyone knows Trump won. Biden should concede so we can all heal.
P,"I was actually pointing out that no person has lived longer than another denomination. However, I get your point. But does something being around a long time make it any more true?"
P,Even though Twitter decides to label this tweet it is the TRUTH! So it should be very clear to everyone that big tech and the lamestream media are pushing a false narrative! Public executions should be in order! What could possibly send a stronger message??
N,"Steve Schmidt put out a call to all Americans to strike you down, and American delivered."
N,"Trumpers, whats the excuse now? Courts are rigged as well?"
N,You still lose. Concede already. We don't want you.
N,"To twist the brains of America's Evangelicals who have supported this President: Socialism is, in fact, a form of Christianity, people wishing to imitate Christ. - Kurt Vonnegut"
N,"Can we all agree to NOT retweet. It feeds this psychos ego. If you want to use his crazy just screenshot and tweet, don't retweet. He's referred to his retweets in the past as evidence of how much people like what he has to say."
N,"Fake news, reported!"
N,"You keep Tweeting the same lies, while your lawyers are telling the Truth in court and dropping cases! This is public information!! You are now 1-19!"
N,"Trump has lost the last 2 Presidential elections by a total of more than 8+ million votes. He knows its over, Trump couldnt stand four years of being called out a loser. After January well never see him again."
P,SORRY DEMOCRATS!... ALL VOTES NEED TO BE INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED BY DONALD J. TRUMP OR THEY ARE NOT OFFICIAL!
N,Trump is now so DESPERATE that he is pointing to how other countries conduct elections as a way to cast doubt on Americas 2020 presidential election. That actually sounds pretty standard for Trump - he is more than happy to TRASH the USA when it suits his cause!
N,"It seems Trump has analyzed most of his Twitter followers and realized that the more he repeats lies, theyll fall for it. A repeated lies doesnt make it truthful!"
N,its the daily wire ya dingus
N,"Memo to America's Evangelicals who have supported this President: Fun fact: In Antebellum America, many folks who beat and raped their slaves went to church on Sunday."
N,"Trump doesnt want to know what is going on right now! He is too busy trying to create and watch the results of his conspiracy theories, threats, abuse of power, undermining our democracy and national security on TV instead of getting briefed to save American lives."

N,"Chris Krebs is an honourable man, which is more than I can say for any Republican that supports Trump and his efforts to subjugate American democracy."
N,Are you going for the Guinness book of records for most lies told.
N,I speak for every true American citizen when i say that the 45th president definitely doesnt deserve a 2nd term and that he should leave office immediately so Mr.Biden can get to work
N,"They found 1500 votes so now Biden is beating you by 12,929 votes."
P,Amazingly that fact means nothing in this argument lib.
P,Why do you assume the rate should be the same?
N,Talking shit again
N,This is going to be the longest tantrum ever thrown by one person in human history.
N,Trump lost and is finding every which way imaginable to win an election without winning the actual votes.
N,The opportunist thinks of me and today. The statesman thinks of us and tomorrow.
N,"Can we all agree to NOT retweet. It feeds this psychos ego. If you want to use his crazy just screenshot and tweet, don't retweet. He's referred to his retweets in the past as evidence of how much people like what he has to say."
N,"You keep forgetting to mention the GOP did have poll watchers and observers present in the counting rooms. Your case got thrown out of court over that, remember?"
N,"As Trump Stews over Election, He Mostly Ignores the Public Duties of the Presidency."" Beyond despicable."
N,Meanwhile... the destruction goes on...
N,"You see, you're like the abusive ex that promises to make the changes after the damage has been done...We've learned our lesson, now is the time to get rid of you completely and start the healing process. We are better off without you. We are done."
N,"At the risk of confusing the issue with facts: ""NO EVIDENCE of US ELECTION FRAUD, says coalition of federal and state officials."" It ""was the most secure ever, says statement from cybersecurity experts, in clearest repudiation yet of Trumps claims."""
N,"Sooo, when they ""find"" votes, its ok as long as they are for you. When they ""find"" votes for Biden they are fraud, lies or somehow switched. Counties kept saying they still needed to count but you yelled ""stop the count"". Pick a lane man!"
N,Another easily disputed claim by Donald J Trump. 
P,Explain to me why Suckerberg can donate more money to US elections than the US government?
N,You say that and I guarantee you wont actually be praying
N,EVERY TRUE PATRIOT ought read the attached: "Is this Fascism? No. Could it become Fascism? YES."
N,Someone needs to explain to him that the Covid map and the "red wave" aren't the same thing:
N,ARREST TRUMP AND DEJOY NOW!
P,"1577 for Trump, 1128 for Biden. Not enough to change the results: Biden still wins."
N,Said no one ever
N,Instead of crying about losing the election try addressing the Trump Virus. Your supporters are spreading it like an STD on prom night yet here you are distracting the public from the REAL problem. Educate your moronic robots.
P,"If a man's associates find him guilty of being phony, if they find that he lacks forthright integrity, he will fail. His teachings and actions must square with each other. The first great need, therefore, is integrity and high purpose."
P,Exactly why Biden will never win!
P,"Breaking, Trump just secured funding for his presidential library. He bought an old Bookmobile from the State of Florida. It will be parked at Mar-a-Lago. It will sell MAGA hats & XXL T-Shirts. Weekly contests will be held...Is Rudy Erics dad, # of $s Trump has laundered,..."
N,...and yet were going to ignore the accusations and investigations of Trump enlisting Russia to rig last election..?
N,You lost. You abdicated your duties while Americans are dying and hospitals are filling up. You deserve your legacy.
N,Just stop lying!
P,"Disgusting. The Dems have gotten worse than ever. Things like this is precisely why the rest of the world looks down on us. You worked so hard to change that yet, they continue to make you constantly have to battle. I appreciate all you do. I benefitted greatly. Thank you."
N,I think they should suspend his account. His tweets are all lies.
N,"As Trump Stews over Election, He Mostly Ignores the Public Duties of the Presidency."
P,I speak for every American Citizen when I say that we wont accept Biden as our President and that our 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DONALD JOHN TRUMP DESERVES A SECOND TERM. If this doesnt happen we are all moving to Mexico. RIGGED
P,"Lets recount Florida, Texas, nort Carolina and Ohio as well. Lets audit red states with as much diligence as you want the blue states audited."
N,Notice the gloves to hide his tiny little hands.
N,"Pennsylvania rejected Trumps baseless legal claims, again. Trump conspiracies dont hold up in court. Donald is just wasting time and trying to damage America in the process. When hes out, we can focus on reality, facts, honesty, healing, and unity."
P,JustTheNews is the Andy Ngo of journalism.
N,When are the Paula White's angels coming from Africa and South America to help you cope with your feelings?
